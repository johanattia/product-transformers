# structured-transformers
TensorFlow implementation of Transformers models for structured data, with a particular focus on time series and tabular data.

## Transformers for Tabular Data

* **S**elf-**A**ttention and **In**tersample Attention **T**ransformer from [SAINT: Improved Neural Networks for Tabular Data via Row Attention and Contrastive Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01342.pdf).

## Transformers for Time Series
* **T**emporal **F**usion **T**ransformers from [Temporal Fusion Transformers for interpretable multi-horizon time series forecasting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021000637).
